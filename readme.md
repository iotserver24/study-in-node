## Virtual Focus Plant and Alarm System

### Virtual Focus Plant

The Focus Plant is a unique feature that provides a visual representation of your study progress:

- The plant starts as a small seedling at the beginning of your study session.
- As you maintain focus and complete study intervals, the plant grows progressively.
- The plant's growth stages may include stem elongation, leaf development, and eventually flowering.
- Completing a full study session results in a fully grown plant, serving as a rewarding visual metaphor for your productivity.

### Alarm System

The alarm system helps you stay on track with your study and break intervals:

- At the end of each study or break period, an audible alarm will sound.
- The alarm can be customized in the settings (volume, tone, etc.).
- Visual cues accompany the audio alarm, such as screen flashes or notifications.
- The alarm ensures you stick to your planned Pomodoro cycles, promoting effective time management.
